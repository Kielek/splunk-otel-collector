1. int64 vs float64 for numeric like nums?
2. Okay, should I move "server" up out of internal?  Would totally get rid of config duplication issues..
    Nah, but move up the parser since that'll eventually go elsewhere anyway
3. configurable suffixes and labels
4. bitset graph for valid prom metric type transitions
5. @ time of actually calling addMetrics we should enable potential locking
    Let's allow a configurable buffer between write requests (parse them though!) and actually attaching/sending metrics?
